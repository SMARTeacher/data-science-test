Thank you for taking the Data Science Challenge!

The goal of this challenge is to test your knowledge of Data Science fundamentals through a series of questions.

<b>Guidelines</b>

<ul>
  <li>This challenge has 5 questions to complete</li>
  <li>You must do your work utilizing a single Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Add comments as much as possible and explain what you are doing and why</li>
  <li>It is very important that everything is explained in a clear and thorough manner</li>
  <li>Apply the appropriate models where applicable</li>
  <li>Assume your audience is non technical business users so give your explanations through comments in a non technical format</li>
 </ul>

<b>Challenge Description</b>

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this challenge, we ask you to complete a series of analysis on the datasets given. The datasets and paths are:

../datasets/data.csv

<b> Getting Started </b>

You have been provided a link to a Binder to create a notebook. If you already have Jupyter it is recommended to use your own environment.

CAUTION: The notebooks are not saved, please export your notebook for submission (File -> Download As).

Give your notebook a title with your full name included Import any libraries you may need

<b>Questions</b>

1. Understanding and visualizing the data

Visualize relationships you feel are important, examples of this may be:

- Age of people who survived
- Gender of the people who survived

2. Deeper analysis of the data.

Explain the relationships you have found in the data. Assume the audience is non technical.

3. How did you handle the missing or bad data?

4. What are the tradeoffs of the impute techniques used in your analysis?

5. Build a model.
  a) How did you verify?
  b) What was the accuracy?
  c) How efficient was it?

Download your notebook (.ipynb) and submit via email.
